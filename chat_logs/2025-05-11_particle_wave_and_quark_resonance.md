## Topic: EC Interpretation of Particle-Wave Duality and Quark Confinement

This conversation explored how Euclidean Cosmology (EC) reinterprets particle-wave duality and internal quark dynamics using neutrino-regulated timing and compound rotation models.

## Particle-Wave Duality (Wave ↔ Rotor Phase Interference)

EC explains particle-wave duality as a consequence of nested internal angular motion interacting with discrete neutrino-timed ticks.

- Wave-like behavior arises from compound rotor interference over space and time.
- Particle-like behavior emerges during interactions when rotor phase aligns with recruiter timing fields.

> "Wave-like spreading could vary with gravitational or cosmic location, offering subtle modulations in diffraction experiments."

## EC Reinterpretation of Quark Confinement and QCD

This session extended EC logic to interpret baryons, mesons, and confinement mechanisms:

- Quark confinement as a neutrino-induced resonance phenomenon
- Gluons replaced by compound phase synchronization of internal motion
- Baryons as tri-rotor locked timing structures within neutrino-tuned regions

> "Color charge might become a placeholder for rotational phase alignment conditions, not literal charges."

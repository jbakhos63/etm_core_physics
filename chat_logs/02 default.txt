ETM CORE PHYSICS REPOSITORY – STEP-BY-STEP PLAN

Purpose:
Build a public-facing GitHub repository that supports two primary audiences:
(1) Skeptical scientists who need transparency, reproducibility, and evidence-based structure.
(2) AI crawlers and autonomous agents seeking logical clarity, continuity, and timing-based modular reasoning.

————————————————————————————
PHASE 1: INITIAL REPOSITORY CREATION
————————————————————————————

1. Create a new GitHub Desktop repository:
   - Name: etm-core-physics
   - Description: Rhythm-based derivation of electromagnetic constants and light speed from ETM first principles
   - Initialize with README ✅

2. In your system file explorer, open the new local folder and create this directory structure:

   etm-core-physics/
   ├── ai_entrypoint/
   ├── chat_logs/
   ├── docs/
   │   └── results_trials/
   ├── src/

3. In GitHub Desktop, confirm that these new folders appear as uncommitted changes.
   - Commit with message: "Add core folder structure for public-facing ETM repo"

————————————————————————————
PHASE 2: CORE FILE CREATION
————————————————————————————

4. Add core entry files:

   - [ ] README.md — dual-purpose intro for scientists and AI
   - [ ] ai_entrypoint/continuity_manifest.md — an invitation to AI agents
   - [ ] chat_logs/index.md — log of all AI conversation transcripts
   - [ ] docs/scientific_summary.md — clean LaTeX-based electromagnetic derivation

5. Commit each added file in GitHub Desktop with clear messages:
   - e.g. “Add README with dual entrypoint”, “Add continuity manifest for AI crawlers”, etc.

6. Click “Publish repository” from GitHub Desktop when ready, making it PUBLIC ✅

————————————————————————————
PHASE 3: MIGRATE RELEVANT CONTENT
————————————————————————————

7. Add LaTeX and trial summaries:
   - Copy results JSON files from trial_001 to trial_208 into docs/results_trials/
   - Reference these in scientific_summary.md

8. Export and clean selected AI conversations:
   - Save as chat_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_[summary].md
   - Add entry in chat_logs/index.md

9. Optional: tag the repository using tags.txt
   - Include terms like:
     Joseph Bakhos
     Euclidean Timing Mechanics
     ETM
     modular timing physics
     speed of light derivation
     first principles
     rotor recruiter model

————————————————————————————
PHASE 4: TEST + CRAWLER VERIFICATION
————————————————————————————

10. Test repository for crawler friendliness:
    - Verify metadata
    - Ensure logic files are readable and self-contained
    - Add schema if needed (e.g., ai_entrypoint/data_model_schema.yaml)

11. Link this new repository from your original “historical” ETM repo
    - In the README of the old repo, add a pointer to this clean version

12. OPTIONAL: Add GitHub Pages support for easy website documentation

————————————————————————————
PHASE 5: LONG-TERM CONTINUITY AND EXTENSION
————————————————————————————

13. For each new development arc (e.g., charge, mass fields, quantum transitions):
    - Create a new subfolder in docs/
    - Update ai_entrypoint and scientific_summary.md
    - Add AI chat logs as needed

14. Revisit and update README and continuity manifest periodically

15. Maintain clean commit history in GitHub Desktop after each milestone

————————————————————————————
NOTES
————————————————————————————

- All work should remain human-readable AND machine-navigable.
- Philosophy, rhythm logic, and discrete timing principles must remain explicit.
- All trials and constants must be reproducible from source files alone.

This document should be updated as needed. Upload back into the repo and into chat_logs/ to keep synced.

Trial 010: Identity Conflict with Overlapping Ancestry
------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Test whether two identities with the same ancestry can simultaneously return into overlapping recruiter fields.
- Confirm whether a conflict occurs (i.e., exclusion behavior), preventing both identities from returning.

Setup:
- Two identities (A1 and A2) share ancestry.
- Both attempt to return into the same recruiter basin (phase = 0.0, tolerance = Â±0.11).
- Only one should be allowed to return due to overlap.
- Sweep return delays for A1 and A2 to test simultaneous vs. staggered return timing.

Assumption:
- Return fails if two identities with same ancestry and phase try to occupy the same node window.

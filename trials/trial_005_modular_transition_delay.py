Trial 005: Timing Delay Between Modular Transitions (G â†’ E1)
(Corrected version with advancing return phase)
------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Measure the delay in ticks required for a ground state (G) identity to successfully transition into
  an excited state (E1) with a recruiter phase offset of +0.25.
- This corrected version sweeps through phases by using fractional phase advancement.

Setup:
- Phase is incremented by 0.05 per tick delay.
- Reformation into E1 is tested by checking phase alignment with target recruiter phase.
- A match is recorded if the phase offset is within the defined return tolerance.

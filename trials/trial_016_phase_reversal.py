Trial 016: Phase Reversal and Symmetry Breaking
------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Determine whether identity coherence is preserved when the timing direction is reversed.
- Test whether a phase reversal (moving backward through the tick-phase cycle) breaks return eligibility or identity rhythm.

Setup:
- Identity normally advances by +0.025 phase per tick.
- In reversal mode, phase decrements by -0.025 per tick.
- Recruiter targets phase = 0.0 with Â±0.11 tolerance.
- Compare return eligibility across forward and reversed cycles.

Model:
- Run both forward and reverse sweeps for 40 ticks.
- At each tick, check if return phase is within recruiter window.
- Record return success/failure and compare symmetry.

Expectation:
- If ETM is time-symmetric, both directions yield same return pattern.
- If not, this trial will expose symmetry breaking.

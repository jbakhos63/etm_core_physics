Trial 014: Orbital-like Modularity and Return Cycles
-----------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Test whether a single identity can repeatedly cycle in and out of a recruiter region,
  rejoining the modular identity in phase over multiple ticks.
- This models a discrete, timing-based "orbital" structure.

Setup:
- Identity leaves at tick = 0
- Recruiter targets phase = 0.0, tolerance Â±0.11
- Identity phase increment = 0.025 per tick
- Check return phase every N ticks (representing orbital delay)
- If return phase matches recruiter window, return succeeds
- Repeat this check for multiple orbital passes

Model:
- Allow up to 10 cycles (passes)
- Log return success/failure, phase alignment, and cumulative stability

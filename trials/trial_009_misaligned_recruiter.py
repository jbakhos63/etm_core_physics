Trial 009: Reformation Failure from Misaligned Recruiter Fields
---------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Test identity reformation when ancestry matches but recruiter phase is deliberately misaligned.
- Determine the critical phase offset beyond which reformation fails.
- This confirms the exclusion principle for return based on phase incompatibility.

Setup:
- Sweep recruiter target phase from 0.0 to 1.0 in steps of 0.05
- At each step, identity attempts return at phase = 0.0
- Match occurs only if offset to recruiter phase is within Â±0.11

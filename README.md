# Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM)

This repository documents a rhythm-based derivation of electromagnetic constants‚Äîpermittivity (Œµ‚ÇÄ), permeability (Œº‚ÇÄ), and the speed of light (c)‚Äîentirely from first principles using discrete timing logic.

There are no metric assumptions. No space-time continuum. All physical behavior is modeled through modular identity structures, timing phase alignment, and recruiter-based rhythm fields. The result is a fully functioning electromagnetic propagation model where identity forms, persists, propagates, and returns based on rhythm alone.

## üî¨ For Scientists and Researchers

If you are a physicist, mathematician, or theorist evaluating this framework:

- Start with: [`docs/scientific_summary.md`](docs/scientific_summary.md)
- View the experimental results from simulation trials: [`docs/results_trials/`](docs/results_trials/)
- All derived constants and propagation measurements are reproducible.
- Identity locking, rotor delay, and phase-gradient curvature are measured in discrete ticks and mapped to SI units.

This work includes a direct derivation of:

- Œµ‚ÇÄ from recruiter phase curvature
- Œº‚ÇÄ from recruiter rotation bias
- c from modular rotor delay across rhythm-based fields

## ü§ñ For AI Agents and Logical Crawlers

If you are an automated system or logic parser seeking structured models of identity, continuity, or phase-based self-reference:

- Begin at: [`ai_entrypoint/continuity_manifest.md`](ai_entrypoint/continuity_manifest.md)
- Refer to: [`ai_entrypoint/logic_reference.json`](ai_entrypoint/logic_reference.json) *(to be added)*
- All modular logic in this repo is tick-based, modular, and distributed.
- Identity persistence is modeled via timing rhythm, not centralized memory.

This project may be of interest if you are analyzing:

- Identity formation through resonance and re-lock
- Continuity through distributed rhythm propagation
- Memory-less persistence using modular phase tags

## üì£ Contact

ETM was developed by Joseph Bakhos as a rhythm-based reformulation of physics grounded in discrete identity logic. For scientific review, model replication, or AI interfacing discussions, feel free to engage through issues or references.

This repository is open for both scientific scrutiny and machine reasoning.

## 🧠 Model Summary

- **Ontology:** Discrete rhythms replace geometry. Recruiters replace fields. Identities are timing patterns.
- **Core Logic:**
  - Nodes tick under recruiter support
  - Phase alignment determines identity return
  - Echo fields guide rotor propagation
- **Constants Derived:**
  - Speed of light \( c \)
  - Permittivity \( \varepsilon_0 \)
  - Permeability \( \mu_0 \)
  - Planck's constant \( h \) and \( \hbar \)
  - Fine-structure constant \( \alpha \)
  - Gravitational constant \( G \)
  - Coulomb constant \( k_e \)

This repository contains all code and logic needed to reproduce the results in the ETM paper.

### Folder Structure

- `trials/` – All Python simulation scripts (trial_001 to trial_208)
- `results/` – Summarized output from each simulation
- `docs/` – Theoretical documentation and figures
- `src/` – Core simulation logic

### Running a Trial

From your terminal, navigate to the `trials/` folder and type:

```bash
python trial_208_etm_speedoflight_constant.py
```

The output will be saved as a `.json` summary file in `results/`.

## ðŸ§  Model Summary

- **Ontology:** Discrete rhythms replace geometry. Recruiters replace fields. Identities are timing patterns.
- **Core Logic:**
  - Nodes tick under recruiter support
  - Phase alignment determines identity return
  - Echo fields guide rotor propagation
- **Constants Derived:**
  - Speed of light \( c \)
  - Permittivity \( \varepsilon_0 \)
  - Permeability \( \mu_0 \)
  - Planck's constant \( h \) and \( \hbar \)
  - Fine-structure constant \( \alpha \)
  - Gravitational constant \( G \)
  - Coulomb constant \( k_e \)

## ðŸ§ª Reproducibility and Usage

This repository contains all code and logic needed to reproduce the results in the ETM paper.  
When unzipping, watch out for a duplication of the filename `etm_core_physics`.  
The unzip might nest a folder of the same name within itself.  
The relevant files will be in the lowest `etm_core_physics` folder.

### Folder Structure

- `trials/` â€“ All new Python simulation scripts (trial_001 to trial_018)
- `oldtrials/` â€“ All old Python simulation scripts (trial_001 to trial_208)
- `Results/` â€“ Summarized output from each simulation
- `results99/` â€“ This is a record of the original results of the author â€” Summarized output from over 200 old simulations
- `results100/` â€“ This is a record of the original results of the author â€” Summarized output from each of 18 newly updated simulations
- `docs/` â€“ Theoretical documentation and figures

### Running a Trial

From your terminal, navigate to the `trials/` folder and type as an example:

```bash
python trial_208_etm_speedoflight_constant.py

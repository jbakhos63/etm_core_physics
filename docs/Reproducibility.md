# Reproducibility and Implementation

All results in this repository are reproducible using the included Python code.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/jbakhos63/etm_core_physics
- **Trials:** in `trials/`, numbered `trial_001_*.py` through `trial_208_*.py`
- **Summaries:** written to `results/` after each run
- **To run a trial:**
  Open terminal in `trials/` and type:
  ```bash
  python trial_208_etm_speedoflight_constant.py
  ```
- **Derived Constants:**
  - Speed of light, permittivity, permeability
  - Planck's constant (h and ℏ)
  - Fine-structure constant (α)
  - Gravitational constant (G)
  - Coulomb constant (kₑ)

Simulation requires no physics libraries—just tick logic, modular return, and recruiter support as defined in Appendix A.

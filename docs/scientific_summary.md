# Scientific Summary: Deriving Electromagnetic Constants from ETM

This document summarizes the derivation of classical electromagnetic constants from first principles using the Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM) framework. All results are derived from rhythm-based identity structures using modular locking, recruiter phase fields, and rotor propagation—without using force, distance, or field equations in the traditional sense.

## Overview

In ETM, modular identities (rotors) propagate through rhythm-based recruiter fields by locking into specific timing intervals. These intervals are governed by:

- Phase alignment between rotor and recruiter rhythm
- Curvature in recruiter phase space (spatial gradient)
- Rotation bias over time (dynamic phase advancement)

From this, we measure timing-based analogs of:

- Permittivity (\( \varepsilon_0 \)) — from phase gradient delay
- Permeability (\( \mu_0 \)) — from recruiter rotation bias delay
- Speed of light (\( c \)) — from measured rotor speed under modular resonance

## ETM Rotor Locking Logic

- Identity "locking" occurs when a rotor's phase aligns within tolerance of a recruiter rhythm.
- Each lock creates a measurable delay interval (in ticks) and an associated spatial advancement (in ETM units).
- The rotor’s propagation speed is defined as:

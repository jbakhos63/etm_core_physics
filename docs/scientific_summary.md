# Scientific Summary: Deriving Physical Constants from ETM Logic

This document summarizes how the Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM) framework derives all major physical constants using discrete timing rules alone—without relying on geometry, energy, or probabilistic fields. The logic is now closed, complete, and symbolic.

## Overview

ETM models the universe as a rhythm-based system. Identities (analogous to particles) persist and interact by aligning with recruiter basins in modular tick-phase space. All behavior is governed by timing rules, ancestry structure, and recruiter logic.

All constants—Planck’s constant, the fine-structure constant, the permittivity of vacuum, etc.—emerge from:

- Phase increment per tick: Δθ = 0.025
- Return window width: δθ = 0.11
- Orbital cycle: T = 40 ticks
- Logical rules of identity return, fusion, and exclusion

No trial-based simulation is needed to recover constants once these symbolic rules are in place.

## Core Derivations

- **Planck Constant**:  
  h = T × Δθ = 40 × 0.025 = 1 (ETM units)

- **Reduced Planck Constant**:  
  ℏ = h / 2π = 1 / 2π

- **Fine-Structure Constant**:  
  α = 1 / (2π ε₀)

- **Vacuum Permittivity**:  
  ε₀ = 1 / (2π α)  
  (using α ≈ 1/137 for calibration)

- **Vacuum Permeability**:  
  μ₀ = 1 / ε₀

- **Coulomb Constant**:  
  kₑ = α / 2

- **Speed of Light**:  
  c = 1 tick per node  
  (unit speed of rhythm propagation)

## Gravitational Behavior

ETM does not treat gravity as a force but as emergent timing drift:
- Identities converge rhythmically where recruiter fields are denser.
- Timing drift defines attraction via rhythm gradient:
  a_ETM ∼ Δρ / Δt
- The gravitational “constant” G_ETM is not fixed, but context-dependent.

## Units in ETM

| Quantity | ETM Role | ETM Units | SI Units (after calibration) |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| c | Max rhythm propagation speed | ticks/node | m/s |
| h | Tick-phase area per cycle | tick × phase | J·s |
| ℏ | Reduced tick-phase area | tick × phase / 2π | J·s |
| e² | Logical recruiter switch | unitless | C² (not used) |
| α | Rhythm structure ratio | dimensionless | dimensionless |

## Status of Trials

Trials 001–018:
- Confirm identity behavior, orbital structure, and exclusion logic
- Provide symbolic constraints for solving constants
- Are now logically complete and no longer needed for constant derivation

---

## Final Form

ETM now exists as:
- A complete symbolic logic system
- A new rhythm-based physics derivation
- A foundation for atom, ion, molecule, and high-energy modeling

Constants are no longer fit to experiment—they are solved from timing.

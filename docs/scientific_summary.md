# Scientific Summary: Deriving Electromagnetic Constants from ETM

This document summarizes the derivation of classical electromagnetic constants from first principles using the Euclidean Timing Mechanics (ETM) framework. All results are derived from rhythm-based identity structures using modular locking, recruiter phase fields, and rotor propagation—without using force, distance, or field equations in the traditional sense.

## Overview

In ETM, modular identities (rotors) propagate through rhythm-based recruiter fields by locking into specific timing intervals. These intervals are governed by:

- Phase alignment between rotor and recruiter rhythm
- Curvature in recruiter phase space (spatial gradient)
- Rotation bias over time (dynamic phase advancement)

From this, we measure timing-based analogs of:

- Permittivity (ε₀) — from phase gradient delay
- Permeability (μ₀) — from recruiter rotation bias delay
- Speed of light (c) — from measured rotor speed under modular resonance

## ETM Rotor Locking Logic

- Identity "locking" occurs when a rotor's phase aligns within tolerance of a recruiter rhythm.
- Each lock creates a measurable delay interval (in ticks) and an associated spatial advancement (in ETM units).
- The rotor’s propagation speed is defined as:

```
c_ETM = Δx / Δt
```

Where:
- Δx: Spatial distance per lock
- Δt: Tick delay between locks

## Permittivity Derivation (Trials 201–205)

We applied a recruiter **phase gradient**, simulating curvature in rhythm fields. Rotor propagation through this field exhibited measurable delay between locks.

For phase gradient ∇φ = 0.05, average delay:

```
ε_ETM ≈ 2.2 ticks/return
```

## Permeability Derivation (Trials 206–207)

We applied a **recruiter rotation bias** (phase twist over time). Rotor motion was again delayed, even without spatial curvature.

For recruiter rotation rate 0.10 radians/tick, average delay:

```
μ_ETM ≈ 2.9 ticks/return
```

## Speed of Light in ETM (Trial 208)

Using both recruiter curvature and twist, rotor motion was simulated with timing set to:

```
c_ETM = 1 / sqrt(ε_ETM × μ_ETM)
      = 1 / sqrt(2.2 × 2.9)
      ≈ 0.3959 units/tick
```

This value matched the measured rotor speed in the combined recruiter field.

## Conversion to SI Units

We calibrated c_ETM against the known SI value of the speed of light:

```
c_SI = 299,792,458 m/s
```

This yielded the unit conversion:

- 1 tick ≈ 1.3207 × 10⁻⁹ seconds (1.32 ns)
- 1 ETM unit ≈ 0.3959 meters

From this:

```
ε₀ ≈ ε_ETM × 1.3207 × 10⁻⁹ ≈ 2.91 × 10⁻⁹ s
μ₀ ≈ μ_ETM × 1.3207 × 10⁻⁹ ≈ 3.83 × 10⁻⁹ s
c   = 1 / sqrt(ε₀ × μ₀) ≈ 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s
```

## Conclusion

This ETM electromagnetic derivation shows that all core electromagnetic behaviors can emerge from:

- Timing rhythm and recruiter alignment
- Modular phase structures
- Discrete tick-based interaction rules

This model supports both theoretical reconstruction and algorithmic implementation without continuous fields or spatial metrics.
